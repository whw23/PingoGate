## Pre-Execution Checks — stock spec-kit extension hooks

Companion runs **on top of** stock spec-kit, so a project's installed spec-kit **extensions** (git, and any others registered in `.specify/extensions.yml`) must still fire on a Companion run exactly as they do on a stock `/speckit.*` run. This is separate from Companion's own node-hooks (`.specify/companion.yml`): both fire. Like the rest of the pipeline, checking these hooks must **never fail the host command** — if anything is missing or malformed, skip silently and continue.

Let `<step>` be this command's phase: `specify`, `plan`, `tasks`, or `implement`.

**Before-hooks — run these *now*, before any of the work below.**
- Check whether `.specify/extensions.yml` exists in the project root. If it does not, skip silently — there are no hooks.
- If it exists, read it and look for entries under `hooks.before_<step>`. If the YAML cannot be parsed, skip hook checking silently and continue normally.
- Filter out hooks where `enabled` is explicitly `false`. A hook with no `enabled` field is enabled by default.
- Do **not** interpret or evaluate a hook's `condition` expression yourself: a hook with no `condition` (or a null/empty one) is executable; a hook with a non-empty `condition` is left to the HookExecutor — skip it here.
- For each executable hook, emit one block based on its `optional` flag:
  - **Optional** (`optional: true`):
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Optional Pre-Hook**: {extension}
    Command: `/{command}`
    Description: {description}

    Prompt: {prompt}
    To execute: `/{command}`
    ```
  - **Mandatory** (`optional: false`):
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Automatic Pre-Hook**: {extension}
    Executing: `/{command}`
    EXECUTE_COMMAND: {command}

    Wait for the result of the hook command before proceeding to the Outline.
    ```
- If no before-hooks are registered, skip silently.

**After-hooks — run these once this command's work is fully reported, before handing off.**
- Re-check `.specify/extensions.yml`; if absent or unparseable, skip silently. Look under `hooks.after_<step>`, applying the same `enabled` / `condition` filtering as above.
- For each executable hook, emit one block:
  - **Optional** (`optional: true`):
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Optional Hook**: {extension}
    Command: `/{command}`
    Description: {description}

    Prompt: {prompt}
    To execute: `/{command}`
    ```
  - **Mandatory** (`optional: false`):
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Automatic Hook**: {extension}
    Executing: `/{command}`
    EXECUTE_COMMAND: {command}
    ```
- If no after-hooks are registered, skip silently.

For `specify`, branch creation is normally one of these `before_specify` hooks (the git extension); spec directory and file creation are always handled by the command body itself.
